Implementation of a basic neural net to recognize handwritten digits.
- The math follows 3Blue1Brown's [video on neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&t=919s&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown) (which is based on  Michael Nielsen's book on [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)).
- The data set is the commonly used MNIST training data.
